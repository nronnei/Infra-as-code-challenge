Ultimately, I didn't get any of the above to actually work. I just went with a standard LoadBalancer type service and that did the trick.

I learned a lot about where TF and K8s overlap as tools in the process of running this project. You can use TF to manage k8s deployments for a GitOps kind of flow, though Rancher/Helm/Fleet do seem to be much better tools for that. I want to ask Matt more about how fleet actually works. Where and how do we get the manifest of charts required for a project? It's opaque to me now, but I know that with a little more practice I could answer that question for myself. I'd just like to have him point me in the right direction.
