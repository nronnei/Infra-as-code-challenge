Provisioning an EKS cluster
Following the tutorial here: https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/eks

Essentially, copy down those files and rename the stuff you want to change. I did this one at a time, copying from the raw files.

I decided to extract the locals out to their own file to reduce my own confusion. Not sure if this is a good practice or not.

I wanted to do more with the security groups. It seems like that setup is over-complicated for what I'm doing, but that's alright for now. That's a place I'd expand my knowledge, though. I'm weak on networking in general.

I also want to get the k8s dashboard set up. Didn't do that as it seemed an unnecessary extra, but that's the next move for exploration purposes. Do this BEFORE playing w/ the vpc/sg stuff.

Running an ALB
Following the tutorial here: https://blog.sivamuthukumar.com/aws-load-balancer-controller-on-eks-cluster

# Add the help repo for eks

helm repo add eks https://aws.github.io/eks-charts

# Install the Load Balancer Controller Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

kubectl apply -k "github.com/aws/eks-charts/stable/aws-load-balancer-controller//crds?ref=master"

# Install the helm chart
helm install aws-load-balancer-controller eks/aws-load-balancer-controller \
  -n kube-system \
  --set clusterName=eks-iqg \
  --set serviceAccount.create=false \
  --set serviceAccount.name=aws-load-balancer


kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.0.0/docs/examples/echoservice/echoserver-namespace.yaml &&\
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.0.0/docs/examples/echoservice/echoserver-service.yaml &&\

Ultimately, I didn't get any of the above to actually work. I just went with a standard LoadBalancer type service and that did the trick.

I learned a lot about where TF and K8s overlap as tools in the process of running this project. You can use TF to manage k8s deployments for a GitOps kind of flow, though Rancher/Helm/Fleet do seem to be much better tools for that. I want to ask Matt more about how fleet actually works. Where and how do we get the manifest of charts required for a project? It's opaque to me now, but I know that with a little more practice I could answer that question for myself. I'd just like to have him point me in the right direction.
